        \n\n Hi my name is George Jose Montano.
        \n\n I love sleep
        \n\n The kind of sleep where we dream of more sleep.
        \n\n I like sleeping at home in my bed where it is comfortable.
        \n\n Sometimes I sleep at work where sneak off to snooze a bit or two.
        \n\n Sometimes I sleep at school while the teacher teaches ones and threes.
        \n\n Once I slept while eating and woke up drooling.
        \n (Scroll down for moreâ€¦)
        \n
        \n\n I enjoy Photography but don\'t know how to use a camera.
        \n\n I just copy and paste images from the internet.
        \n\n
        \n\n I like to draw people and animals.
        \n\n But can only draw sticks and circles.
        \n\n
        \n\n I used to cook the best pancit canton on Earth.
        \n\n But Lucky Me changed their recipe.
        \n\n The end.
